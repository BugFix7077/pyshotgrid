An object oriented python library for Autodesk ShotGrid.

For the Autodesk Maya guys: This aims to be what `pymel` is to `maya.cmds`.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pyshotgrid.readthedocs.io.

Is it faster than `shotgun_api3`?
---------------------------------
No, and since it is build on top of shotgun_api3, it never will be.
The goal is to make the syntactic sugar faster to develop. :)
